Week  3 - 4 Notes:
This last two weeks we have worked on the SRS and we where trying to make sure that we could get the SDD done early to try and get coding sooner.
We may have under estimated the size of the SDD task though. As I think about it, in Software I, we took 6 weeks to create a quality SDD, and we have given ourselves 1 week to do the same for and actual project here. That might be a bit tight. We had some good meetings, but things are still bumpy with how they flow. Things will get better as we grow as a team. The hard part is that when we really hit our stride, we will be right at the end of the course. It would be neat to work together longer to be able to accomplish more, but the experiance will be good still. 


Week 5 - 6 Notes:
This past two weeks I have been working to catch up on my biweekly assignments because I have put my focus on the team project stuff.
This last sprint we had two meetings with the customer and we have meet as a student team for around 7 or 8 hours total between all of the 
meetings that we have had. We have played planning poker twice now and we seem to be getting that down. The SDD and SRS are now complete and
we can start working on the actual project. Most eviroments are setup, but Richard made some changes to how the code base was setup and 
we will need to make sure we pull the updated changes. As far as status, I think this question is asking how I am doing in the class. I
believe that I am pulling my weight and that things are going fairly well. The class has been slow to do stuff during the weeks that nothing is 
due, but I think that coding will liven everyone up. 

Week 7 - 8 Notes:
This past two weeks I have worked on learning about NestJS and have been able to connect the backend to the frontend of the project. I will need to continue to learn how this all works to shore up my understanding of the project and these technologies. Assigned to help others understand how I was able to do this. Will do a group programming session to work this out. 

Week 9 - 10 Notes:
This past two weeks I have worked on the issue of not having validation all the way setup in the DTO's of the backend for the create user features. I was able to learn about how the class-validator from nestjs works and add these validators to the code base. I attended meetings and particapated in the team meetups for coding when they applied to what I had been assigned. I also completed my one-on-ones with Anne. 

Week 11 - 12 Notes:
